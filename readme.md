# Pokemon prioritizer

Used to set the wanted IV priority for RealDeviceMap's IV scanning


## Notes
This was a fun test project entirely generated with **ChatGPT** (GPT-4).

Some things I came up to when generating (prompting) this page:
* ChatGPT seems to have a very short memory, it keeps forgetting stuff you mentioned and you sometimes need to start over
* GPT-4 is slow, I might have coded this faster myself than prompting the language model, hope this will get faster in the future
* ChatGPT keeps hitting the text limit constantly, requiring me to ask for it to continue generating
* Styling issues are a problem with LLM's too! They seem to have a constant struggles with stuff like overflowing and having annoying scroll bars everywhere
* You need to be **strict** with the prompts you give it, sometimes it might replace old features with the new one you requested as you did not specify you want it on top of the old feature
* Debugging is sometimes hard and I tried to do as much as possible I could with chatgpt, sometimes I had to intervene and figure out myself what the bug was so I could ask chatgpt to fix it
* I also started generating the git commits with chatgpt, you might see where the change happened.
* The dockerfile and github action is also generated with chatgpt
